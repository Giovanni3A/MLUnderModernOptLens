# MLUnderModernOptLens

"Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens" course (2023, PUC-Rio). Professor: Davi Michel Vallad√£o.

In this course we studied multiple chapters of the book "Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens" (2019, Dimitris Bertsimas and Jack Dunn), implementing and evaluating proposed algorithms and techniques. The goal was to develop a strong sense of existing connections between ML technique that are usually used for certain problems and linear/quadratic/integer optimization models and we also studied machine learning topics, such as boosting, reinforcement learning and neural networks from other sources.

The repository is segmented by classes and doesn't follow a rigid format, but each class folder contains the julia code developed and the pdf file with details (written in brazilian portuguese).
